# OAuth Callback Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated OAuth Callback Redirect Behavior

The Google OAuth callback (`/api/company/google/callback/`) now redirects users to their company-specific dashboard after successful OAuth authentication.

#### Before:
- Redirected to: `/dashboard/settings?google_oauth=success`
- Generic redirect for all users

#### After:
- Redirects to: `/companies/{company_id}/dashboard?google_oauth=success`
- Company-specific dashboard redirect
- Fallback to `/dashboard/settings?google_oauth=success` if user has no company

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

All OAuth errors now redirect to the frontend instead of showing plain HTML error pages:
- Invalid OAuth state: Redirects with `?google_oauth=error&message=Invalid OAuth response or session expired`
- User not found: Redirects with `?google_oauth=error&message=User not found`
- General exceptions: Redirects with `?google_oauth=error&message={error_details}`

### 3. Updated Next.js Example

The frontend example (`next-js-google-oauth-example.js`) has been updated to:
- Handle company-specific dashboard routing (`/companies/[companyId]/dashboard`)
- Show enhanced success messages with call-to-action text
- Properly handle the new redirect structure
- Include detailed comments about routing requirements

### 4. Updated Documentation

The implementation guide (`GOOGLE_MEET_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) now includes:
- Updated OAuth flow description with company-specific redirects
- Clear explanation of the redirect behavior
- Instructions for handling the new URL structure

## Frontend Integration Requirements

Your Next.js app should have routes that match:
- `/companies/[companyId]/dashboard` - Company-specific dashboard
- `/dashboard/settings` - Fallback dashboard

Both routes should check for `google_oauth` query parameters and display appropriate success/error messages.

## Testing the Changes

1. Initiate OAuth flow from company dashboard
2. Complete Google OAuth consent
3. Verify redirect goes to `/companies/{company_id}/dashboard?google_oauth=success`
4. Check that success message appears on the dashboard

The OAuth flow now provides a seamless user experience by redirecting users back to their specific company dashboard after connecting Google Calendar.
