# Smart Question Management Strategy

## Current Issues:
1. If AI fails to generate questions for any skill, job remains incomplete forever
2. No fallback mechanism for failed question generation
3. High AI costs for repeated attempts

## Cost-Effective Solutions:

### 1. Question Pool System
- Create a pre-generated pool of common questions for popular skills
- Use AI-generated questions as primary, pool questions as fallback
- Reduces AI calls while maintaining quality  .

### 2. Retry with Exponential Backoff
- 1st attempt: AI generation (immediate)
- 2nd attempt: AI generation (1 hour delay)
- 3rd attempt: Use question pool + mark skill as "fallback mode"

### 3. Smart Completion Logic
- Mark job complete if 80%+ of skills have questions
- For missing skills, use fallback questions or mark as "portfolio review only"

### 4. Question Quality Tiers
- Tier 1: AI-generated, job-specific questions (best)
- Tier 2: AI-generated, general skill questions 
- Tier 3: Pre-made question pool (fallback)
- Tier 4: Portfolio/resume review only (no questions)

### 5. Cost Optimization
- Cache similar skill combinations
- Reuse questions for similar job levels
- Batch process multiple skills in one AI call
