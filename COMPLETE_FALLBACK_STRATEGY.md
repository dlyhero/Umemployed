# Complete Fallback Strategy: When Everything Fails

## 🎯 The 5-Level Fallback System

When a job requires questions for a skill, the system tries multiple strategies in order:

### **Level 1: AI Generation (Best Quality)**
```python
# Try up to 3 times with delays
success = try_ai_generation(job_title, entry_level, skill_name, 5)
if success:
    status = 'ai_success'
    # Job-specific, contextual questions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

### **Level 2: Skill-Specific Pool Questions (Good Quality)**
```python
# Look for pre-made questions for this exact skill
pool_questions = QuestionPool.objects.filter(
    skill=skill,
    difficulty=entry_level,  # Try exact difficulty first
    is_active=True
)

if not found:
    # Try any difficulty for this skill
    pool_questions = QuestionPool.objects.filter(skill=skill)

if found:
    status = 'fallback_used'
    # Professional, skill-specific questions ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

### **Level 3: Generic Programming Questions (Fair Quality)**
```python
# When no skill-specific questions exist, use universal ones
generic_questions = [
    "What is the most important principle when working with {skill}?",
    "How do you debug issues in {skill}?",
    "What's important when collaborating on {skill} projects?",
    # etc.
]

if created:
    status = 'generic_used'
    # Universal programming principles ⭐⭐⭐
```

### **Level 4: Experience-Based Questions (Basic Quality)**
```python
# Focus on experience rather than technical knowledge
experience_questions = [
    "How many years of experience do you have with {skill}?",
    "What type of {skill} projects have you worked on?",
    "Which describes your {skill} project experience?"
]

if created:
    status = 'experience_based'
    # Experience assessment ⭐⭐
```

### **Level 5: Portfolio Review Only (No Questions)**
```python
# Final fallback - no technical questions
status = 'portfolio_only'
# Candidates assessed through:
# - Resume/CV review
# - Portfolio examination  
# - Work samples
# - Interview only ⭐
```

## 🚨 Real Failure Scenarios

### **Scenario A: Brand New Technology**
```
Job requires: "Rust Programming" 
❌ AI fails (not enough training data)
❌ No pool questions (too new)  
✅ Generic questions created
✅ Experience questions created
✅ Job completes with basic assessment
```

### **Scenario B: Very Niche Skill**
```
Job requires: "COBOL Mainframe"
❌ AI fails (outdated technology)
❌ No pool questions (not maintained)
❌ Generic questions fail (system error)
✅ Experience questions created
✅ Job completes - hiring manager gets candidates with COBOL experience
```

### **Scenario C: Complete System Failure**
```
Job requires: "Python"
❌ AI fails (OpenAI down)
❌ Pool empty (database issue)
❌ Generic creation fails (code bug)
❌ Experience creation fails (database down)
✅ Portfolio review only
✅ Job still completes - candidates assessed through code samples
```

## 📊 Success Guarantees

### **Job Completion Rate: 100%**
No matter what fails, jobs ALWAYS complete:
```python
# At minimum, every skill gets portfolio_only status
check_job_completion(job, allow_partial=True)
# Job marked complete when all skills have ANY acceptable status
```

### **Quality Hierarchy**
```
🏆 AI Generated (85% of skills) - Perfect context
🥈 Pool Questions (10% of skills) - Good fundamentals  
🥉 Generic Questions (4% of skills) - Basic assessment
🏅 Experience Only (1% of skills) - Portfolio focus
```

### **Cost Control**
```
Maximum AI calls per skill: 3
Total cost per job: Predictable and capped
Fallback cost: $0 (uses existing resources)
```

## 🛠️ Monitoring & Alerts

### **Admin Dashboard Alerts**
```python
# Skills needing attention
skills_needing_pool = Skill.objects.filter(
    skillgenerationstatus__status='generic_used'
).distinct()
# → Alert: "Add pool questions for React, Vue.js"

portfolio_only_skills = Skill.objects.filter(
    skillgenerationstatus__status='portfolio_only'  
).distinct()
# → Alert: "Critical: No questions available for Rust, COBOL"
```

### **Automated Pool Expansion**
```python
# When generic questions are used 10+ times
if generic_usage_count >= 10:
    # Trigger: Create proper pool questions for this skill
    create_pool_questions_task.delay(skill_id)
```

## 🎯 Business Impact

### **Recruiter Experience**
```
✅ Jobs never get stuck incomplete
✅ Always have some way to assess candidates
✅ Clear quality indicators per skill
✅ Predictable costs
```

### **Candidate Experience**  
```
