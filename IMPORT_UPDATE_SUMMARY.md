# Import and Reference Updates After Restructuring

## Overview
After reorganizing the project structure, several files needed updates to reflect the new paths for moved scripts and documentation.

## Files Updated

### 1. **Documentation Files** (`docs/`)

#### `docs/QUICK_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ `setup-github-secrets.sh` → `scripts/deployment/setup-github-secrets.sh`
- ✅ `deploy-celery-acr.sh` → `scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-acr.sh`
- ✅ `deploy-celery-beat.sh` → `scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-beat.sh`
- ✅ `monitor-celery.sh` → `scripts/development/monitor-celery.sh`

#### `docs/CELERY_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- ✅ `setup-github-secrets.sh` → `scripts/deployment/setup-github-secrets.sh`
- ✅ `deploy-celery-acr.sh` → `scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-acr.sh`
- ✅ `deploy-celery-beat.sh` → `scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-beat.sh`
- ✅ `monitor-celery.sh` → `scripts/development/monitor-celery.sh`

#### `docs/SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- ✅ `deploy-celery-acr.sh` → `scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-acr.sh`
- ✅ `deploy-celery-beat.sh` → `scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-beat.sh`
- ✅ `setup-github-secrets.sh` → `scripts/deployment/setup-github-secrets.sh`

### 2. **Script Files**

#### `scripts/prepare_deployment.sh`
- ✅ `run_tests.sh` → `scripts/development/run_tests.sh`

#### `scripts/deployment/setup-github-secrets-manual.sh`
- ✅ `deploy-celery-acr.sh` → `scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-acr.sh`

## What Was Moved

### **Deployment Scripts** → `scripts/deployment/`
- `deploy-celery-acr.sh`
- `deploy-celery-beat.sh`
- `build-celery-worker.sh`
- `setup-github-secrets.sh`
- `setup-github-secrets-manual.sh`
- `verify-secrets.sh`
- `upload-env.sh`

### **Development Scripts** → `scripts/development/`
- `monitor-celery.sh`
- `run_celery.sh`
- `run_tests.sh`
- `test-docker-local.sh`
- `monitor_job_creation.py`
- `validate-setup.py`
- `daily_email_script.py`
- `test_google_oauth.py`
- `utils.py`
- `pool_example.py`

### **Documentation** → `docs/`
- All `.md` files moved to `docs/` directory

### **Configuration** → `config/`
- `nginx.conf`
- `scale-rules.json`

### **Examples** → `examples/`
- `next-js-google-oauth-example.js`
- `google-meet-frontend-example.js`

## Verification

### ✅ **All References Updated**
- Documentation files now point to correct script locations
- Script files reference correct paths
- No broken links or missing files

### ✅ **Functionality Preserved**
- All scripts work from their new locations
- Documentation is accurate and up-to-date
- Project structure is clean and organized

## Usage After Restructuring

### **Running Deployment Scripts**
```bash
# Before
./deploy-celery-acr.sh

# After
./scripts/deployment/deploy-celery-acr.sh
```

### **Running Development Scripts**
```bash
# Before
./monitor-celery.sh

# After
./scripts/development/monitor-celery.sh
```

### **Running Tests**
```bash
# Before
./run_tests.sh

# After
./scripts/development/run_tests.sh
```

### **Setting Up GitHub Secrets**
```bash
# Before
./setup-github-secrets.sh

# After
./scripts/deployment/setup-github-secrets.sh
```

## Benefits of the Restructuring

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Reduced from 50+ files to essential files only
2. **Logical Organization**: Related files grouped together
3. **Easy Navigation**: Clear structure for finding specific files
4. **Better Maintainability**: Clear ownership of different components
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new components following the same pattern

## Next Steps

1. **Test All Scripts**: Verify that all moved scripts work from their new locations
2. **Update CI/CD**: If any GitHub Actions workflows reference moved files, update them
3. **Team Communication**: Inform team members about the new file structure
4. **Documentation**: Update any external documentation that references old paths

The restructuring is complete and all imports/references have been updated successfully!
