# ===== STEP 5: Candidate Experience =====
"""
When candidates apply to this job:

Python Questions: 
- 5 AI-generated, job-specific questions about web frameworks

React Questions:
- 3 AI-generated questions about modern React patterns  
- 2 Pool questions about fundamental React concepts

PostgreSQL Questions:
- 4 Pool questions covering essential database concepts

Docker Assessment:
- No technical questions
- Portfolio review section asks about containerization experience
- Resume parsing looks for Docker keywords

Git Questions:
- 5 AI-generated questions about version control workflows
"""

# ===== COST ANALYSIS =====
"""
AI Calls Made:
- Python: 1 successful call
- React: 3 attempts (2 failed, 1 partial success)  
- PostgreSQL: 3 failed attempts
- Docker: 3 failed attempts
- Git: 1 successful call

Total: 11 AI calls
Successful generations: 2.6 out of 5 skills (52% success rate)
Job completion: 100% (thanks to fallback pool)

Without Pool System:
- Job would be stuck incomplete
- Continuous retry attempts
- Much higher costs
- Poor user experience
